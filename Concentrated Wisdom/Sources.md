You are probably wondering how I have come to know/believe all of the statements I make in this blog. Many of these ideas come from my favorite science/philosophy texts, but I have done my best to confirm that they are also consistent with the clearest available scientific understanding wherever possible. I have meditated, prayed, and generally considered many seemingly strange ideas to determine whether I can find consistency in them and determine whether the ideas withstand logical tests. My conclusions may not always be right; I only seek truth as consistently as possible and find ever-greater distillations of it as time moves forward.

If you want to search for your own information on these topics (as I highly recommend you do), here are a few good informational sites to search. Site search is easy with Google. Search sites like this:
